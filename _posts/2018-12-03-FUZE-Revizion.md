    <td>Persevering</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I thought to myself, "Will the weeks of knowledge that we already have be useful in the test or will the test be about our ability to put pieces of code at the right points?". </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We knew that we were going to have a test on FUZE at some point in the year, presumably at the end of the term, so we both decided to make a revision sheet to use and to add on to in the future.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Looking back at the lesson I feel as if though we had fully accomplished our target.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We listened to the instructions from when we first started to work on FUZE so we knew the basic outlines of what to revise for. </td>
