  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>At the start of the lesson, when we had to work out how to start up the Fuze boxes, our display port from the monitor did not fit the HDMI port in the Fuze box, and so we had  to ask the teacher for another cable which would fit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself, "What other programming can you do with the Fuze box."</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I only worked with my partner and only used the book for help as we had to work together.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought back to when we did the penultimate stage of the Hello World program and wondered what we could do next.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I really understood and enjoyed the lesson because it was independent and effective.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If I could have realised earlier on that the display port will not fit the HDMI port on the Fuze box then we would have been one of the first ones to finish. As tis was one of the first things we said. Also we could have found the Fuze program a lot quicker.</td>
