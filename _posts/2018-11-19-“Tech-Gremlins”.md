  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We continued to try and make sure that our code was working, changing all the parts and restarting the programming.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself, "Why is this going wrong, and how can I fix this?"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We both worked together figuring out why it wasn't working without asking for help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We thought back to last week and remembered how we used a different method to complete the task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened to my partner and we worked successfully together.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>If we had asked for help earlier as we knew that our code was right we would have known straight away that or breadboard and robot arm were not working so we could have more time to do other work.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I need to ask for help more often as we knew we were correct, to improve my learning.</td>
