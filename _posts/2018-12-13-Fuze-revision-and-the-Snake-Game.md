    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We have around a third of the snake game code completed and a revision sheet that we made last week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To get at least half of the code written down and to revise some terminology.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes we wrote half of the code for the snake game and tested each other on terminology.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>One of our pieces of code was broken as we had an unassigned variable but we fixed it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself, "what other things can you program on fuze?"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We worked on our own not asking for help and we fixed our problems effectively.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We could have fixed them more efficiently by using the search tool.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We listened to the instructions at the end of the lesson for our homework.</td>
